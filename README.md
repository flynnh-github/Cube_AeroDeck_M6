# Aerodynamic Coefficients of a Cube in Mach 6 Flow

This repository provides correlations for the aerodynamic coefficients of a cube in Mach 6 flow.
The correlations were developed from CFD data calculated using the transient, compressible flow solver Eilmer (https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/eilmer/about/).

## Force and Moment Coefficients

We model our aerodynamic forces $\bm{F}$ and moments $\bm{M}$ as force and moment coefficients

$[\bm{F}] = [[],[],[]]$
